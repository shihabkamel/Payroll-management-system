### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shihabkamel/Payroll-management-system.git
   cd Payroll-management-system
   ```

2. **Set Up the Web Server**:

   - Place the project folder in your web serverâ€™s root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Ensure the server is running (e.g., start Apache and MySQL via XAMPP).

3. **Create the Database**:

   - Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin).
   - Create a new database (e.g., `payroll_db`).
   - Import the provided SQL file (e.g., `database.sql` in the project root, if available):
     ```sql
     SOURCE /path/to/database.sql
     ```

4. **Configure Database Connection**:

   - Open the database configuration file (e.g., `config.php` or similar in the project root).
   - Update the database credentials:
     ```php
     <?php
     define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
     define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
     define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
     define('DB_NAME', 'payroll_db');
     ?>
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to the project URL (e.g., `http://localhost/Payroll-management-system`).
   - Ensure all files are accessible and the database is connected.

## Configuration

- **PDF Generation**: If the project uses a PDF library (e.g., TCPDF), ensure it is installed or included in the project directory.
- **File Permissions**: Set appropriate permissions for directories (e.g., `chmod 775 uploads/` for file uploads, if applicable).
- **Email Notifications** (Optional):
  - If email functionality is implemented, configure PHPâ€™s `mail()` function or an SMTP service in your configuration file:
    ```php
    ini_set('SMTP', 'smtp.gmail.com');
    ini_set('smtp_port', '587');
    ```

   - Access the admin panel (e.g., `http://localhost/Payroll-management-system/admin`).
   - Use default credentials (check `database.sql` or project documentation):
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`
   - Manage employees, process payrolls, and generate reports.

2. **Employee Access**:

   - Employees can log in to view their payslips and submit leave requests (if implemented).
   - Example URL: `http://localhost/Payroll-management-system/employee`.

3. **Payslip Generation**:

   - Admins can select a payroll period, calculate salaries, and generate payslips.
